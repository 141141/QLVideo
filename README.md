Quicklook Video
===============

QuickLook and Spotlight on OSX 10.9 and later understand a limited number of media files - mostly only MPEG audio and video codecs within MPEG container files. This package adds support for wide range of other codecs and "non-native" media file types, including `.asf`, `.avi`, `.flv`, `.mkv`, `.rm`, `.wmf` etc.

This package allows OSX Finder to display thumbnails, previews and metadata for most types of video files.

Limitations
-----------
* You may experience high CPU and disk usage for a few minutes after installation while Spotlight re-indexes all of your "non-native" audio and video files.
* The QuickLook "Preview" function displays a static snapshot of "non-native" video files.
* Anamorphic content is always squished in QuickLook thumbnails and previews of "non-native" video files.
* Interlaced content is sometimes not de-interlaced in QuickLook thumbnails and previews of "non-native" video files.
* Depending on which media player app(s) you have installed Spotlight may not index the metadata in some "non-native" audio and video files.
* Ogg audio and video files are not supported.
* Requires OSX 10.9 or later. Use [Perian](http://github.com/MaddTheSane/perian) for equivalent functionality under 10.8 and earlier.
